# Maravel-BOT

Hi everyone!
This is my bot written in node js

1) First, to start using it, we need to install the packages that are listed in package.json (the command to install the necessary packages npm install).

2) Next step, we need to create MongoDB database (Atlas)

3) After that we need to create config.json files in the bot root

In config.json we need lines such as:
{
    "token": "your bot's token",
    "prefix": "your bot's prefix"
}

Attention, this bot has copyright!
